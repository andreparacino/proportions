# Ratios

The easiest way to calculate proportions!

Let's say a recipe says to use 50g of flour per 750ml of milk, and you want to know how many mls of milk you'll need having 64g of flour, the math should look something like this:  

***50 : 750 = 64 : x*** (or, in a less european way to write it: ***50/750 = 64/x*** )

That eventually, running the math would result to:

***x = 750 x 64 / 50***

***x = 960***

**Ratios** does exactly that! just in a user friendly and "smooth" way. It also allows you to choose the precision (specifying the amount of decimals after the comma).
You can try and test the app [here](https://ratios.netlify.app/).

### Structure

The project runs on **React + TypeScript** and to style it I went **CSS Modules + SASS + SUIT CSS naming convention**, a solution that served me very well in the past years.
